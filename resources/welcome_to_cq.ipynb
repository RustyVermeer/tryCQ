There are several different methods for using CadQuery in addition to using them inside Jupyter notebooks, but the philosphy behind Jupyter fits nicely with what CadQuery aims to achieve. As such, we hope you enjoy using it here!\n",

    "\n",
    "Inside a notebook you have a view of *cells* which can contain either text or code. This cell is a *markdown* cell used for inline explanations and documentation. The cell below is a *code* cell, which is interpreted by the **kernel** as python code. If you ever set up your own installation, you will have the ability to install different kernels that allow you to create notebooks for different languages. Powerful stuff!\n",

    "Behind the scenes, the software that powers this is [tmpnb](https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb), a  Tornado application that spawns [pre-built Docker containers](https://github.com/ipython/docker-notebook) and then uses the [jupyter/configurable-http-proxy](https://github.com/jupyter/configurable-http-proxy) to put your notebook server on a unique path.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Highlight the cell containing the CadQuery (often shortened to CQ) script. \n",
    "2. Press CTRL + ENTER or hit the RUN button.\n",
    "3. Once the cell is run, you'll see a few boxes input boxes that appear alongside a *Run Interact* button. Click the button.\n",
    "4. Have a look at your Geometry! Scroll wheel will zoom in and out. Hold Left click and drag to rotate the object around. Hold Right Click and drag to shift the frame.\n",
    "5. Change values around in the inputs and press *Run Interact* again to regenerate a new geometry. Re-run the cell to reset everything.\n",

    "There's always room to improve the documentation, of course so if you run into confusion or lack of documentation, your next best bet is to [dive into the code](https://github.com/dcowden/cadquery). It's well written, so we hope you'll be able to grasp the details well enough to proceed. \n",
