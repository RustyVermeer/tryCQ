The cell below is a *code* cell, which is interpreted by the **kernel** as python code. If you ever set up your own installation, you will have the ability to install different kernels that allow you to create notebooks for different languages. Powerful stuff!\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Highlight the cell containing the CadQuery (often shortened to CQ) script. \n",
    "2. Press CTRL + ENTER or hit the RUN button.\n",
    "3. Once the cell is run, you'll see a few boxes input boxes that appear alongside a *Run Interact* button. Click the button.\n",
    "4. Have a look at your Geometry! Scroll wheel will zoom in and out. Hold Left click and drag to rotate the object around. Hold Right Click and drag to shift the frame.\n",
    "5. Change values around in the inputs and press *Run Interact* again to regenerate a new geometry. Re-run the cell to reset everything.\n",
